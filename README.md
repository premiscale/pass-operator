# `pass` secrets operator

A Kubernetes operator to sync and decrypt secrets from a password store ([pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)) Git repository. This operator is proposed as a proof-of-concept and shouldn't be used in any production capacity.

While this approach to secrets management on Kubernetes is more technically challenging, the advantage is that we don't have to rely on a 3rd party SaaS platform, such as Vault or Doppler, to hold our secrets (the obvious benefits these platforms do provide, however, are better user and access management). We may also use this operator in an airgapped environment with a self-hosted git repository.

<!--
I also acknowledge that this approach swims against the DevSecOps tide in that it requires you to store your secrets (albeit encrypted)
in Git, a practice that is often discouraged and typically forbidden at most organizations.
-->

## How it works

The following flowchart outlines how this operator reacts to `PassSecret`-related events and pass store updates.

</p>

From a high level, this operator runs `git pull` on an interval to grab updates from a git repository populated with encrypted
secrets by `pass`. It maps secrets' paths to data values through the application of a [`PassSecret`](helm/operator/crds/PassSecret.yaml), a [custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/), such as the following.

```yaml
apiVersion: secrets.premiscale.com/v1alpha1
kind: PassSecret
metadata:
  name: mysecret
  namespace: pass-operator-test
spec:
  encryptedData:
    mykey: premiscale/mydata
  managedSecret:
    metadata:
      name: mysecret
      namespace: pass-operator-test
    type: Opaque
    immutable: false
```

The above `PassSecret` manifest translates to the following `Secret`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysecret
  namespace: pass-operator-test
stringData:
  mykey: <decrypted contents of premiscale/mydata>
immutable: false
type: Opaque
```

## Installation

See the [chart README](https://github.com/premiscale/pass-operator/tree/helm-readme/helm/operator) for an overview of operator installation and configuration options.

## Development

### Unit tests

Run unit tests with

```shell
yarn test:unit
```

### End-to-end tests

Run e2e tests against a live (local) environment with

```shell
yarn test:e2e
```

This command will

1. Stand up a local 1-node minikube cluster with 4 cores, 4GiB memory and 30GiB storage. *(Modify [./scripts/minikube.sh](./scripts/minikube.sh) if these resources are unsuitable for your local development environment.)*
2. Create a `localhost` docker registry redirect container.
3. Build both e2e (hosts a git repository with encrypted pass secrets that match paths found in [./src/test/data/crd](./src/test/data/crd/)) and operator container images, as well as push these images to the local redirect for minikube to access.
4. Installs both e2e and pass-operator Helm charts.
5. Run e2e tests.
6. Tear down the cluster and local registry, as well as cleans up locally-built artifacts.

### Coverage

Test coverage against the codebase with

```shell
poetry run coverage run -m pytest
poetry run coverage report -m pytest
```
